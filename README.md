# AI-Powered Star Tracker (To Be Developed)

This project aims to develop an AI-powered star tracker that can detect stars from images or live streams of the night sky and estimate the location and time of observation based on star patterns. The project will involve using star catalogs, celestial coordinates, and machine learning techniques to recognize star constellations and estimate key data from the sky.

## Project Goals
- **Star Detection**: Develop a system that can identify stars in images of the night sky.
- **Pattern Matching**: Use star catalogs (e.g., Gaia, HIPPARCOS) to match detected stars to known celestial objects.
- **Location Estimation**: Estimate the location (latitude/longitude) of the observer based on star positions.
- **Time Estimation**: Estimate the time of the observation by comparing star positions to known celestial data.
- **Visualization**: Implement a visualization system that overlays detected stars on the image, and displays estimated location and time.

## Learning Path & Key Areas of Focus

### 1. **Image Processing and Computer Vision**
   - Learn how to process images of the night sky to detect stars. This involves techniques such as:
     - **Image enhancement**: Improve contrast and sharpness of night sky images.
     - **Star detection**: Use algorithms like blob detection or edge detection to locate stars in the images.
     - **Tools to Learn**: OpenCV, Scikit-Image

### 2. **Star Catalogs and Celestial Coordinates**
   - Familiarize yourself with star catalogs like Gaia and HIPPARCOS, which contain information on star positions, magnitudes, and other characteristics.
   - Learn how to map detected stars to celestial coordinates (right ascension, declination) using the catalogs.
   - **Tools to Learn**: Astropy (Python library for astronomical calculations), FITS file format

### 3. **Pattern Matching and Triangulation**
   - Develop methods for matching detected stars to star catalogs and recognize patterns in the sky to estimate the observer's location and time.
   - Implement triangulation techniques to determine the location based on detected star positions.
   - **Key Concepts**: Spherical geometry, celestial triangulation, pattern recognition.

### 4. **Machine Learning and AI Integration**
   - Explore the use of machine learning to enhance star detection accuracy or even predict star patterns.
   - Train models to recognize constellations or other celestial bodies based on image data.
   - **Tools to Learn**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Scikit-learn (optional for advanced pattern matching)

### 5. **Geolocation and Time Estimation**
   - Learn how to estimate the location of the observer based on the observed star patterns, and estimate the time based on the position of the stars in the sky.
   - **Key Concepts**: Latitude/longitude calculation, celestial mechanics, time zones, and astronomical time.

### 6. **Visualization**
   - Learn how to visualize the detection results by overlaying detected stars on the original image or creating interactive maps.
   - Develop a user interface (optional) to allow users to interact with the data and visualize star positions and estimated time.
   - **Tools to Learn**: Matplotlib, Plotly, Dash (for interactive visualizations)

## Project Steps

1. **Research and Prototype**:  
   Start by learning about the tools and techniques you'll need for image processing, star detection, and celestial mechanics. Work through tutorials on OpenCV, Astropy, and other related libraries.

2. **Star Detection**:  
   Write code to process images of the night sky, detecting stars using methods like blob detection or edge detection.

3. **Star Matching**:  
   Implement pattern matching to correlate detected stars with a star catalog (e.g., Gaia). Learn to use celestial coordinates to match stars accurately.

4. **Location and Time Estimation**:  
   Use the matched star positions to estimate the observer's location (latitude/longitude) and time of observation. This will likely involve using triangulation or similar techniques.

5. **Visualization**:  
   Develop visualizations that display the detected stars overlaid on the original images and show the estimated location and time.

6. **Testing and Validation**:  
   Write tests to validate the accuracy of the star detection, location, and time estimation. Collect a dataset of images to test the system on various sky conditions.

7. **Documentation**:  
   As you develop the project, make sure to document your findings and progress in the README and provide usage instructions for others.
